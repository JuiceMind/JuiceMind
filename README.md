# Welcome to the JuiceMind Community!

Welcome to the home of the JuiceMind community where you can submit issues and feature requests to the official JuiceMind Team.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to improving JuiceMind with your valuable feedback!

## How it works

- **Submit Issues and Feature Requests:** If you encounter any problems or bugs or have a great idea for a new feature, please [submit an issue or feature request](https://github.com/JuiceMind/JuiceMind/issues/new) so we can address it promptly.

- **View our roadmap:** If you want to see exactly what's actively being worked on at JuiceMind (bugs and features), please [view our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/JuiceMind/projects/1/views/1).

## How do we assign deadlines?
- **Categorization** Every Sunday the JuiceMind team takes the tasks from the week and make sure they are all appropriately categorized in the roadmap and assigned a specific target deadline.
- **Prioritization** Tasks are to be completed in the following priority: 1. Critical Issues (major bugs or features), 2. High Profile (JuiceMind partners who have critical feature requests), 3. Customer Requests (Any request from a JuiceMind customer), 4. Low priority (Any bugs or requests which are not urgent) 

Thank you for being a part of the JuiceMind community!
